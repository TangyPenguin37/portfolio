  I led a team of 3 in the development and management of a new website and
  ticketing system for the annual
  <a href="https://kingsaffair.co.uk/"><u>King's Affair</u></a> May Ball event
  at King's College, Cambridge. This involved designing and implementing the
  front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as working with our
  ticketing provider, <a href="https://bookoxex.com/"><u>OXEX</u></a
  >, to create a ticketing system to handle several thousand attendees and
  several hundred thousand pounds in revenue.

    The role involved working and liaising with the rest of the event committee,
    OXEX, and the wider King's College community to ensure the systems met all
    stakeholder requirements, as well as being responsible for all ticketing and
    IT infrastructure and managing guest entry on the night of the event.
