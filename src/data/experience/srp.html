  I undertook an 8-week summer project with the Department of Zoology,
  developing machine learning models to identify invasive moth species using
  wing morphology and/or image analysis. The aim was to improve the accuracy and
  efficiency of current identification methods for farmers in Brazil monitoring
  crop pests.

  I used TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn in Python to train and evaluate several
  models, alongside ImageJ to extract morphological features from the images.
  The project culminated in several presentations to the department and wider
  university community, discussing the results and findings of the research.
